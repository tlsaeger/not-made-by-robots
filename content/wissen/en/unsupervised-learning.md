In contrast to [supervised learning](wissen/supervised-learning), unsupervised learning feeds data into the model that does not have a label. It is therefore not clear whether an image is a dog or a cat. The model has the task of making this distinction itself. It is important to note that the model does not suddenly have a flash of inspiration and realise that this is a cat and this is a dog. The expected outcome is rather that this group of images is one thing, that group of images is another.

Unsupervised learning models are therefore very well suited to clustering data and recognising patterns in it. A very well-known example of unsupervised learning is the so-called Generative Adversarial Networks. Once trained, these are able to generate new images.
