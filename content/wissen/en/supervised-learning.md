Supervised learning is best explained with an example: There are 100 dog pictures and 100 cat pictures. Each of these data sets consists of a picture and a label, either cat or dog. 80% of this data is used to "train" the neural network. Once the network is trained, the remaining 20% of the data can be used to validate the training. Here, the image is shown without a label, whereupon, as already mentioned, the machine outputs the label. If the accuracy of the output is still not optimal, further and/or better data can be used to retrain. A concrete example would be the recognition of a tumour on an X-ray image, with sufficient training data, i.e. images and labels. In this way, it would be possible, for example, to distinguish whether the tumour detected is malignant or benign. Radiologists could thus be supported in their work, as the machine already makes a preliminary selection of potential malignant tumours. It is also conceivable that this process could be completely taken over by a machine at some point. This type of ML is particularly suitable if the goal is to emulate "human" recognition, distinguish dogs from cats, understand language, etc.
